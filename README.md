# 🎥 Torus & SDL

This project is my take on the classic **rotating torus** example.  
As a personal twist, instead of rendering it in the terminal, I used the **SDL** library to display it on screen.  
Rendering it in the terminal was getting too complex (and honestly, less satisfying 😅), so I went with a graphical window.
